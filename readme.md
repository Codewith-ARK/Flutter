# Flutter

Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows you to build native-looking apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

This repository contains a collection of Flutter projects that I have created. The projects are divided into the following categories:

* **Basic:** These projects demonstrate the basic concepts of Flutter, such as state management, routing, and animation.
* **Intermediate:** These projects are more complex and demonstrate more advanced Flutter features, such as Firebase integration and custom widgets.
* **Advanced:** These projects are the most complex and demonstrate the full power of Flutter.

I hope you find these projects helpful and inspiring. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.

## Getting started

To get started with Flutter, you will need to install the following:

* The Flutter SDK
* A code editor or IDE

Once you have installed the Flutter SDK, you can follow the instructions in the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to create a new Flutter project.
